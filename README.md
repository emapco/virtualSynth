# virtualSynth
A simple keyboard synth that you can play with your keybaord or mouse.
You can change the octave by using the up and down arrows.

This web app has been tested in Chrome, Edge, and Webstorm's built-in browser.

There seems to be a bug with Firefox and the exponentialRampToValueAtTime function. 
Instead of ramping to the gain to 0 in 1 second, the gain is constant for a second then it clips and stops.
